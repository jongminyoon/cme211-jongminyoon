CME211 HW3 Class Airfoil and lift coefficients

class airfoil
	variable/data :inputdir,  panel coordinates, alpha, pressure coefficients
	method : chord length, find stagnation point, calculate cx, cy, and then cl, print

Class attributes
	count : number of coordinates.
	xy[0] : x coordinates, xy[1] : y coordinates, both are lists
	alphas : dictionary {alpha : [list of the pressure coefficients]}
	chordlength = chord length, from tail to head.
	cl : dictionary, {alpha : cl}
	stgpt : dictionary, {alpha : [(x,y),cp]}

Things learned
	for file reading, first execute f.readline() and then for line in f: -> for-loop reads from the second line.
	import os, glob -> files = glob.glob(inputdir+"*"), filenames = [x for x in os.path.split(files)[1]]
	when make two dimensional array as a list of lists, think well about which index should be the outer one, i.e. easier to approach the data.

 Note, values of cl are different from the hw3 printout... there is sth I misunderstand about in caculating cl...
